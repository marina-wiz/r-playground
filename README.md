# r-playground

## Description

Welcome to r-playground, a collection of various R functions and scripts that Iâ€™ve developed for data wrangling, statistical analysis, and visualization. This repository serves as a sandbox where I explore new ideas, test different approaches, and store useful snippets that may not fit neatly into any single project.

## Content

- **`match_controls()`** This function performs case-control matching by taking a dataset of cases and matching each case with observations from a dataset of potential controls. You can specify how many controls should be matched to each case, and on which characteristics (e.g., age, sex) the matching should be based. The function returns the dataset of cases with added columns with the IDs of the matched controls, ensuring that each control is only used once. When there are no matched controls are available for a case, "No controls available" is returned. 

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marina-wiz/r-playground.git
```

Alternatively, you can download the files directly from the GitHub interface.

## Loading the Script

Each script in this repository is self-contained and can be sourced into your R environment as needed. 

```r
source("path/to/match_controls.R")
```

## Usage

### 1. `match_controls()`

```r
# Set seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Create example dataset for the case group with 100 observations
study_dat <- data.frame(
  ID = 1:100,
  age = sample(20:60, 100, replace = TRUE),
  sex = sample(c("Male", "Female"), 100, replace = TRUE)
)

# Create example dataset for control group with 1000 observations
control_dat <- data.frame(
  ID = 1:1000 + 100,  # IDs start from 101 to avoid overlap with study_dat
  age = sample(20:60, 1000, replace = TRUE),
  sex = sample(c("Male", "Female"), 1000, replace = TRUE)
)

# Match 2 controls to each case based on age and sex variables
matched <- match_controls(study_dat, control_dat,
                          match_cols = c("age", "sex"),
                          id_col = "ID", num_controls = 2)
```
